# Node.js-Essentials
Node.js Essential training

This course starts off by defining how Node.js works with this event driven, asynchronous, non-blocking IO model. We'll discover how an event loop is at the core of Node.js and how single threaded applications can handle many connections quickly. We'll focus on streams, the file system, the HTTP module, the guts, the stuff that is used to make it all happen.
